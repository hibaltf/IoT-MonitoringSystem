# IoT-Based-Health-Monitoring-System-(Simulation) 
This project is a simulation of a health monitoring system dashboard using dash python/dash library,
It shows the health state of the patient : temperature, heart rates and position.
Also it shows the conditions of the room so we can make sure that the patient is in the perfect environment : room temperature / room humidity.
